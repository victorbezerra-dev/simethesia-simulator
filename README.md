## 🧪 Discrete-Time PK/PD Models (Euler method)

The simulator uses Euler discretization to numerically solve continuous-time equations, introducing a small computational delay equal to the sampling interval (Ts):

### 1. Pharmacokinetic Model (3-compartment):

#### 📌 Variables Description
- **`c₁`, `c₂`, `c₃`**: Concentrations in central and peripheral compartments (shallow and deep).
- **`V₁`, `V₂`, `V₃`**: Volumes of distribution for each compartment.
- **`k₁₀`**: Elimination rate constant from the central compartment.
- **`k₁₂`, `k₂₁`, `k₁₃`, `k₃₁`**: Transfer rate constants between compartments.
- **`u`**: Infusion rate (drug input rate).
- **`Ts`: Discrete sampling interval (simulation step size)

#### 📐 Model Equations
The three-compartment pharmacokinetic model equations in continuous-time are:

```text
dc₁/dt = (u / V₁) − (k₁₀ + k₁₂ + k₁₃) × c₁ + (V₂ / V₁) × k₂₁ × c₂ + (V₃ / V₁) × k₃₁ × c₃  
dc₂/dt = (V₁ / V₂) × k₁₂ × c₁ − k₂₁ × c₂  
dc₃/dt = (V₁ / V₃) × k₁₃ × c₁ − k₃₁ × c₃
```
Discretized equation using Euler:

```text
c₁[k+1] = c₁[k] + Ts × [(u[k]/V₁) − (k₁₀ + k₁₂ + k₁₃)c₁[k] + (V₂/V₁)×k₂₁×c₂[k] + (V₃/V₁)×k₃₁×c₃[k]]
c₂[k+1] = c₂[k] + Ts × [(V₁/V₂)×k₁₂×c₁[k] − k₂₁×c₂[k]]
c₃[k+1] = c₃[k] + Ts × [(V₁/V₃)×k₁₃×c₁[k] − k₃₁×c₃[k]]
```

### 2. Effect-site Compartment (Pharmacodynamic Model):

#### 📌 Variables Description
- `Ce`: Effect-site concentration (responsible for clinical effect)
- `ke₀`: Rate constant determining the speed of drug equilibration between plasma and effect-site compartment
- `c₁`: Central compartment (plasma) concentration
- `Ts`: Discrete sampling interval (simulation step size)

#### 📐 Model Equations
The pharmacodynamic (PD) model describes the relationship between plasma drug concentration and clinical effect, represented by the effect-site concentration (`Ce`). The continuous-time equation is:

```text
dCe/dt = ke₀ × (c₁ − Ce)
```
Discretized equation using Euler:

```text
Ce[k+1] = Ce[k] + Ts × ke₀ × (c₁[k] − Ce[k])
```
### 3. BIS Calculation:

#### 📌 Variables Description
- `BIS`: Bispectral Index (0–100)  
- `E₀`: Baseline BIS (~95–100, awake state)  
- `Emax`: Maximum drug effect  
- `Ce₅₀`: Concentration at 50% of maximal effect  
- `γ` (gamma): Steepness of the drug-response curve  
- `Ce`: Effect-site concentration from PD model

#### 📐 Model Equations

The BIS equation in continuous-time are:

```text
BIS(t) = E₀ − (Emax × Ce(t)^γ) / (Ce₅₀^γ + Ce(t)^γ)
```

Discretized equation using Euler:

```text
BIS[k] = E₀ − (Emax × Ce[k]^γ) / (Ce₅₀^γ + Ce[k]^γ)
```


## ⚠️ **Important Note on Simulation Delay**

The discretized equations used in this simulation introduce a computational delay equal to one sampling interval (`Ts`).  
This occurs because variables calculated at step `[k+1]` depend explicitly on values from the previous step `[k]`, placing the results one sampling step into the future.

This one-step delay (`Ts`) accurately represents the inherent computational delay observed in real-world digital control systems. When developing and testing your control algorithms, remember to account for this delay to ensure accurate performance evaluation and realistic simulation outcomes.

** 🚨 Clinical challenges available:**

Use these challenges to simulate realistic physiological scenarios and test the robustness of your anesthesia controller:

- `0`: **Normal conditions** — Baseline simulation without any disturbances (default).
- `1`: **Hemorrhage** — Simulates blood loss, reducing central compartment volume and increasing drug elimination.
- `2`: **Vasodilation** — Increases blood vessel volume, changing the drug's distribution and reducing concentration effectiveness.
- `3`: **Vasoconstriction** — Decreases blood vessel volume and reduces drug equilibration speed, increasing drug concentration responsiveness.
- `4`: **Vasoactive Drugs** — Simulates administration of drugs altering cardiovascular response, affecting distribution and maximum drug effect.
- `5`: **Neuronal Instability** — Reduces brain sensitivity, decreasing baseline BIS responsiveness to the anesthetic, representing challenging neurological scenarios.
